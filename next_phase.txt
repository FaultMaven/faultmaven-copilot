Project Summary: FaultMaven Copilot - Side Panel UI (Phase 1 Completion)
Issue:
The original FaultMaven browser extension side panel UI was functionally complete but suffered from layout inefficiencies, excessive visual prominence of secondary actions, and inconsistent component sizing. The "Submit Data" and "New Conversation" buttons were too prominent, input areas were loosely structured, and the overall visual hierarchy lacked clarity.

Improvements Made (Phase 1):

🧩 Refined Layout: Conversation, query input, and data submission are now compartmentalized using space-efficient, neatly bordered sections.

📐 Visual Hierarchy: Secondary actions like "New Conversation" have been visually de-emphasized and moved to the bottom of the side panel.

🎛️ Radio + Action Alignment: Radio buttons for selecting data source are vertically aligned on the left, with the "Submit Data" button right-aligned on the same row.

📥 Contextual Input Display: Each radio selection reveals the relevant input mechanism just below (text area, file input, or "Analyze Current Page" button).

🔒 Button Enable Logic: "Submit Data" is only enabled when valid input is present—text entered, a file selected, or page content fetched.

🔧 Compact, Fixed Buttons: All buttons are center-aligned where appropriate and uniformly sized for a consistent, unobtrusive appearance.

Next Phase: Proposed Improvements
Session Awareness: Show current session ID or allow naming sessions for reference.

Conversation Management: Add timestamps, message threading, or collapsible conversations.

Data Preview: Preview uploaded file contents or page summary before submission.

Responsiveness: Improve layout behavior on narrower side panel widths.

UX Enhancements:

Add tooltips for each radio button and action.

Provide subtle animation on submission or loading.

Show character count for inputs (especially logs).

Styling Polish:

Use color tokens for theming consistency.

Create reusable button and section components for maintainability.

When you resume, we can pick up from any of these priorities—or refine the scope based on your next goal
